## 💼 Using This for Job Applications

### In Your Resume
```
PROJECT: A/B Test Statistical Analysis
- Designed and analyzed simulated A/B test with 10,000 users
- Performed hypothesis testing achieving 95% statistical power
- Quantified business impact: $225K+ projected annual revenue
- Tools: Python, SciPy, Statsmodels, Jupyter
GitHub: github.com/yourname/ab-testing-decision-analysis
```

### In Cover Letters
```
"I recently completed an A/B testing analysis project that demonstrates
my ability to translate statistical findings into business recommendations.
This project showcases exactly the type of data-driven decision-making
that [Company] values."
```

### In Interviews
**Be ready to explain:**
- What is a p-value?
- When would you use a t-test vs z-test?
- How do you calculate confidence intervals?
- What's the difference between statistical and practical significance?
- How would you communicate these results to executives?

## 🔥 Why This Project Works

1. **Relevant** - A/B testing is used everywhere (Google, Meta, Amazon)
2. **Complete** - Shows entire workflow from data to decision
3. **Clear** - Non-technical people can understand it
4. **Professional** - Production-quality code and documentation
5. **Impressive** - Goes beyond basic tutorials

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

### Statistical Tests
- Two-proportion z-test
- Two-sample t-test
- Confidence intervals (95%)
- Cohen's h effect size
- Statistical power

### Business Metrics
- Conversion rate
- Absolute lift
- Relative lift
- Revenue impact
- ROI calculation

## 🎓 Interview Talking Points

### Technical
"I implemented both z-tests and t-tests to compare conversion rates,
calculated 95% confidence intervals, and achieved over 95% statistical
power with 5,000 users per group."

### Business
"The analysis showed a 2.5% absolute lift in conversions, which translates
to $225,000 in additional annual revenue based on realistic traffic
assumptions."

### Communication
"I made sure to explain p-values and confidence intervals in plain English
because in real projects, stakeholders aren't always technical."
